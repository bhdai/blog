Traditional education often starts with the basics and slowly builds up to more complex topics. However, Jeremy Howard and Rachel Thomas believe that learning is more effective when you see the big picture first.\nIn the fastai course, we start by building practicall applications from lesson one, allowing us to see immediate results and understanding the relevance of what we are doing. This approach mirrors how we learn many real-word skills, such as sport or cooking, where we start by trying out the activity and learn the details as needed.\nBy diving straight into creating a deep learning model, we get hands-on experience early on, which helps solidify our understanding and maintain our interest. As we process though the course, we gradually delve deeper into the underlying principles and theories, bulding a robust foundation along the way"

It uses multiple layer of neural networks, where each layer refines the data received from the previous one. These layers are trained using the algorithms that minimize the errors and improve accuracy, enabling the network to learn specific tasks.\nDeep learning’s power, flexibility, and simplicity make it applicable across various field, including social science, medicine, finance, and more. For instance, despite lacking of medical background, Jeremy Howard founded Enlitic, a company leveraging deep learning to diagnose illnesses. Within months, their algorithm was more effective at identifying malignant tumors than radiologists.\nHere are some areas where deep learing excels:\n\nNatural Language Processing (NLP): Answering question, speech recognition, document summarization, and more.\nComputer Vision: Interpreting satellite images, face recognition, and automous vehicle navigation.\nMedicine: Analyzing radiology images, measuring features and medical scans, and diagnosing diseases.\nBiology: Protein folding, genomics tasks, and cell classification.\nImage Generation: Colorizing images, enhancing resolution, and converting images to artistic style.\nRecommendation System: Web search optimization, product recommendations, and personalized content layout.\nGaming: Mastering games like Chess, Go, and various video games.\nRobotics: Handling challenging objects and complex manipulation tasks.\nOther: Financial forecasting, text-to-speech conversion, and much more.\n\nThe versatility of deep learning lies in its foundation: neuron networks."

    "section": "Exploring the “Is it a Bird?” Classifier",
    "text": "Exploring the “Is it a Bird?” Classifier\nOne of the most exciting part of Lesson 1 was building our own image classifier to determine whether the a given image contains a bird. For this project, we used the fastai libray along with pre-trained model to quickly and efficiently create our classifier. Let’s dive into the code walkthrouh.\nThe basic steps we’ll need to do:\n\nUse DuckDuckGo for search images of “bird photos”\nUse DuckDuckGo to search for images of “forest photos”\nFine-tune a pretrained neural network to recognise these two groups\nTry running this model on a picture of bird and see if it works.\n\n\nSearching for images: DuckDuckGo Search\nInstead of using a big search that reqires an API key, we opted to DuckDuckGo, which doesn’t reqire an API key for image searches. This make the setup simpler and faster.\nBut make sure you run this command in your terminal before run the code to update duckduckgo\npip install -Uqq fastai duckduckgo_search\n\nfrom duckduckgo_search import DDGS\nfrom fastcore.all import *\n\nddgs = DDGS()\n\ndef search_images(term, max_images=30):\n    print(f\"Searching for '{term}'\")\n    return L(ddgs.images(keywords=term, max_results=max_images)).itemgot('image')\n\n\nurls = search_images('bird photos', max_images=1)\nurls[0]\n\nSearching for 'bird photos'\n\n\n'https://images.pexels.com/photos/326900/pexels-photo-326900.jpeg?cs=srgb&dl=wood-flight-bird-326900.jpg&fm=jpg'\n\n\nJeremy Howard mentioned that using import * in Jupyter notebooks is not the big deal because Jupyter only import what we use. This approach simplifies the code and keeps it clean.\nHere’s the quick explaination of the functions and libraries used in this snippet:\nDDGS from duckduckgo_search:\n\nduckduckgo_search: This library allows us to search for iamges using DuckDuckGo without the need for an API key. So no more begging Google for an API key.\nDDGS: The class that does the heavy lifting of searching for images.\n\nfastcore: - fastcore: A foundattional library that make Python feel like a Lamborghini-sleek, powerfull, and fast.\nL:\n\nL: A magical list from fastcore that does way more than the regular Python list. Think of it as a list on steroids.\n\nIn our example, search_images is a function that performs an image search using DuckDuckGo. It’s print out the search term being used and return a list of images URLs retrieved from the search results.\nfor more details on the tools, you can refer to the fastcore documentation and the duckduckgo_search documentation.\n\nfrom fastdownload import download_url\ndest = 'bird.jpg'\ndownload_url(urls[0], dest, show_progress=False)\n\nfrom fastai.vision.all import *\nim = Image.open(dest)\nim.to_thumb(256,256)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ndownload_url(search_images('forest photos', max_images=1)[0], 'forest.jpg', show_progress=False)\nImage.open('forest.jpg').to_thumb(256,256)\n\nSearching for 'forest photos'\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfastdownload and download_url:\n\nfastdownload: Think of this as your friendly neighborhood delivery service, but for files. It’s help with downloading files and datasets easier.\ndownload_url: A function that fetches the file you need from a URL. In our case, it says “Hey URL, gimme that picture!” and save it as bird.png\n\nfastai.vision.all:\n\nTThis module from the fastai library is like a Swiss Army knife for vision tasks, providing all the tools you need, from data loaders to model training utilities.\n\nto_thumb: - A method from the PIL.Image class, which is quite handy it resizes an image to a thumbnail while maintaining the aspect rato. Kind of like shrinking your favourate sweater but in a good way\nThese libraries and function streamline the process of getting and preparing the images for our model. For more detailed documentation, you can refer to the fastdownload, fastai vision, and Pillow documentation.\n\n\nDownloading and Preparing Images\nTo build our dataset, we need to download images for the categories we are interested in (‘forest’ and ‘bird’). Here’s how we did it:\n\nsearches = 'forest','bird'\npath = Path('bird_or_not')\nfrom time import sleep\n\nfor o in searches:\n    dest = (path/o)\n    dest.mkdir(exist_ok=True, parents=True)\n    download_images(dest, urls=search_images(f'{o} photo'))\n    sleep(10)  # Pause between searches to avoid over-loading server\n    download_images(dest, urls=search_images(f'{o} sun photo'))\n    sleep(10)\n    download_images(dest, urls=search_images(f'{o} shade photo'))\n    sleep(10)\n    resize_images(path/o, max_size=400, dest=path/o)\n\nSearching for 'forest photo'\nSearching for 'forest sun photo'\nSearching for 'forest shade photo'\nSearching for 'bird photo'\nSearching for 'bird sun photo'\nSearching for 'bird shade photo'\n\n\nPath:\n\nPath: An object-oriented way to work with filesystem paths. It makes handling files and directories as easy as pie.\n\ndownload_images:\n\ndownload_images: This function fetches a bunch of images from the internet and saves them in a specified directory. Like ordering a pizza, but instead of pizza, you get pictures.\n\nPausing Between Searches:\n\nPausing between searches (sleep(10)) is important to avoid overloading the server. Think of it as giving the server a coffee break between each request.\n\nresize_images:\n\nresize_images: A function from fastai that resizes images to a maximum specified size. This is useful for ensuring all images are of a consistent size before training the model.\n\nFor more details on these tools, you can refer to the pathlib, Vision utils documentation.\n\n\nVerifying and Leaning Images\nAfter download images, it’s enssential to verify them and remove corrupt or invalid images.\n\nfailed = verify_images(get_image_files(path))\nfailed.map(Path.unlink)\nlen(failed)\n\n0\n\n\nverify_images:\n\nverify_images: Think of this as the bouncer for your image dataset, checking IDs to make sure no bad images get through.\n\nget_image_file:\n\nget_image_file: This function grabs all image paths in a directory. It’s like having someone fetch all your misplaced socks in the laundry room.\n\nPath.unlink:\n\nPath.unlink: A method to delete files. This is how we get rid of the bad apples in the bunch.\n\nFortunately, in my case, all downloaded images were valid, so len(failed) return 0–no bad apples in our dataset!\n\n\nThe DataBlock API\nCreating our data loarder is a critical step. The DataBlock API in fastai allows us to define how to transform and manage our data easily.\n\ndls = DataBlock(\n    blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock), \n    get_items=get_image_files, \n    splitter=RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.2, seed=42),\n    get_y=parent_label,\n    item_tfms=[Resize(192, method='squish')]\n).dataloaders(path, bs=32)\n    \ndls.show_batch(max_n=6)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere’s the breakdown of the arguments in DataBlock:\nblocks:\n\nSpecifies the type of inputs and targets. In our case, we have images (ImageBlock) and categories (CategoryBlock). It’s like saying, “I have pictures of cats and dogs”\n\nget_items:\n\nFunction to get the list of items. Here we’re using get_image_file to retrieve all our iamge files.\n\nsplitter:\n\nDefines how to split the dataset into training and validation sets. RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.2, seed=42) means 20% of the data will be used for validation. The seed ensures that every time we run the code we get the same split. Think of like setting your DVR to record your favourate show at the same time everyweek.\n\nget_y:\n\nFunction to get the target label from each item. We use parent_label to get the label from parent directory name (e.g., ‘forest’ or ‘bird’)\n\nitem_tfms:\n\nitem transformation to apply. We use Resize(129, method='squish') to resize images to 129x129 pixels by squishing them if necessary.\n\ndataloaders:\n\nCreates the data loaders for our dataset, with a batch size of 32. Data loaders are like conveyor belt that feed the data into your model in manageable chunks.\n\nThe show_batch method is handy way to visialize a batch of data items. It’s like a quick preview to make sure everything looks good.\nFor more details, checkout the fastai DataBlock API documentation.\n\n\nTraining the Model: Welcome to the Learner World\nAfter preparing our dataset, it’s time to train our model. We use the vision_learner function to setup a learner and the powerful fine_tune method to train the model.\n\nlearn = vision_learner(dls, resnet18, metrics=error_rate)\nlearn.fine_tune(3)\n\nDownloading: \"https://download.pytorch.org/models/resnet18-f37072fd.pth\" to /root/.cache/torch/hub/checkpoints/resnet18-f37072fd.pth\n  0%|          | 0.00/44.7M [00:00&lt;?, ?B/s]100%|██████████| 44.7M/44.7M [00:00&lt;00:00, 145MB/s] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\nerror_rate\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n1.120399\n1.209828\n0.411765\n00:01\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\nerror_rate\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.185352\n0.054729\n0.029412\n00:01\n\n\n1\n0.102830\n0.023147\n0.000000\n00:01\n\n\n2\n0.072183\n0.049310\n0.029412\n00:01\n\n\n\n\n\nvision_learner:\n\nThis create a learner object that combines our data loaders(dls) and a pre-trained model(resnet18). We basically saying, “Hey, take this data and use this model to learn from it.”\n\nresnet18:\n\nA specific architecture of a Convolutional Neuron Network that’s been pre-trained on a large dataset. Think of it as seasoned detective who’s seen it all and just need to be briefed on this specific case.\n\nmetrics=error_rate:\n\nThis specifies that we want to use the error rate as a metric to evaluate our model’s performance. It’s like having a scoreboard to keep track of who’s winning.\n\n\nfine_tune(3):\n\nHere’s where the magic happens. Unlike the traditional fit mothod, fine_tune starts by refining the pre-trained model with our specific data. It’s like taking your detective and train them on a nuances of this particular mystery. The 3 indicates the number of epochs (full cycles throught the training data).\n\nThe fine_tune method is particularly powerful because it starts with a model that already knows a lot (thanks to pre-training) and fine-tune it to specific task. This approach often yields better results, faster and with less data, compared to tranning a model from scratch.\n\n\nMaking Predictions\nFinally, let’s make our bird classifier predict whether or not an image contain a bird.\n\nis_bird,_,probs = learn.predict(PILImage.create('bird.jpg'))\nprint(f\"This is a: {is_bird}.\")\nprint(f\"Probability it's a bird: {probs[0]:.4f}\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is a: bird.\nProbability it's a bird: 0.9988\n\n\nPILImage.create:\n\nThis function create a image object from a file. It’s like saying “Hey, look at this picture I just took.”\n\nlearn.predict:\n\nThis method uses our train model to predict what’s in a image. It’s like asking your well-trained detective, “What do you see in this picture?”\nThe method returns three values:\n\nis_bird: The predicted label(whether it’s a bird or not).\nprobs: The probabilites associated with each class.\n\n\nWhen we print out the predicted label and the probability. If the model says it’s a bird with a high probability, you can feel pretty confident your model knows its bird!\nBuilding the “Is it a Bird?” classifier was hands-on way to introduce the principles of deep learning. By leveraging fastai and Pytorch, we could quickly create an effective model with minimal code. This approach of starting with practical, top-down learning ensures that we see immediately results and understand the real world applicability of deep learning from the get-go."

    "section": "What Is Machine Learning",
    "text": "What Is Machine Learning\nAh, the age-old question: What is the machine learning? Well, imagine if your computer was a child, and you were its teacher. Instead of giving it a a strict set of rules to follow(which, let’s be honest, kids hate), you give it examples from which it can learn. In enssence, machine learning is about enabling computer to learn from data rather than being explicitly programmed. It’s like teaching your computer how to ride a bike by letting it practice, fall and get up again, rather than reading it a manual\nLet’s take a closser look at this with a series of visualizations:\n\nTraditional Programming\nIn traditional Programming we write explicit instructions-a program-that processes input to procude results.\n\n\nCode\nfrom fastbook import *\ngv('''program[shape=box3d width=1 height=0.7]\ninputs-&gt;program-&gt;results''')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink of it as following a recipe step-by-step: preheat the oven, mix the ingredients, bake for 30 minutes, and volià, you have a cake.\n\n\nProgram Using Weight And Assignment\nIn machine learning, we use model with weights(parameters) that processes inputs to generates result.\n\n\nCode\ngv('''model[shape=box3d width=1 height=0.7]\ninputs-&gt;model-&gt;results; weights-&gt;model''')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, the model is like a reflexible recipe that can adjust itself. The ingredients(inputs) are mixed differently depending on the weights, and the ouput is a delicious result that varies based on those adjustments.\n\n\nTraining a Machine Learning Model\nTraining a model involves feeding inputs through the model to produce results, measuring performance and updating the weights to improve accuracy.\n\n\nCode\ngv('''ordering=in\nmodel[shape=box3d width=1 height=0.7]\ninputs-&gt;model-&gt;results; weights-&gt;model; results-&gt;performance\nperformance-&gt;weights[constraint=false label=update]''')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThink of it as trial and error. The model tries to bake a cake, and if it’s to salty, it adjusts the recipe (update the weights). Over time, it learns the perfect proportions.\n\n\nUsing a Trained Model\nOnce the model is trained, it can be used just like a tranditional program, taking inputs and producing results predictably.\n\n\nCode\ngv('''model[shape=box3d width=1 height=0.7]\ninputs-&gt;model-&gt;results''')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, you have reliable recipe that consistently makes the perfect cake. The model processes new inputs(ingredients) and produces outputs(cakes) with the learned adjustments."

    "text": "What Our Image Recognizer Learned\nAt this stage, we have an image recognizer that works very well. But what is it actually doing? Although many people believe that deep learning results in inpenetrable “black box” models (where predictions are given, but no one understand why), this isn’t entirely true. There is a vast body of reseach showing how to inspect deep learning model deeply and gain rich insights for them. However, all kind of machine learning model (including machine learning and traditional statistical models) can be challenging to fully understand, especially when dealing with new data that differs significantly from the training data.\nWhen we fine-tuned our pre-trained model, we adapted the last layers(originally trained on general features like flowers, humans, animals) to specialize in a birds versus non-birds problem. Imagine our model initialy knew how to recognize the entire zoo, but now we’ve trained it to focus solely on recognizing birds. More generally, we could specialize such a pre-trained model on many different tasks."

    "text": "Beyond Image Classification: Other Application of Deep Learning\nDeep learning isn’t just about figuring out whether there’s bird in your photo. It’s way more powerful than that! Let’s explore a couple of areas where deep learning make significant strides:\n\nImage Segmentation:\nSegmenation is a process of identifying and labling pixles in an image belonging to the same object. This is critically important for application like autonomous vehicles where the car needs to recognize and localize object such as pedestrians, other vehicles, and road signs. Instead of just saying, “Hey, there’s a cat in a picture”, segmentation says, “Here’s the outline of the cat in this picture”.\nNatural Language Processing (NLP): Deep learning has drammatically improved Natural Language Processing over the last few years. Now computers can:\n\nGenerate text: Write conherent and context-aware essays (but don’t trust them with your love letters just yet).\nTranslate languages: Turn English into Spanish, French, or Klingon (okay, maybe not Klingon…yet)\nAnalize comments: Understand sentiments, detect sarcasm, and probably tell when you’re being a bit snarky.\nLabel words in sentences: Identify parts of speech (nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.), entities (like names and places), and more.\n\n\nHere’s some cool code to classify the sentiment of a movie review better than anything availible just a few years ago:\n\nfrom fastai.text.all import *\ndls = TextDataLoaders.from_folder(untar_data(URLs.IMDB), valid='test')\nlearn = text_classifier_learner(dls, AWD_LSTM, drop_mult=0.5, metrics=accuracy)\nlearn.fine_tune(4, 1e-2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      100.00% [144441344/144440600 00:03&lt;00:00]\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n      \n      100.00% [105070592/105067061 00:01&lt;00:00]\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\naccuracy\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.462561\n0.395122\n0.822320\n03:08\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nepoch\ntrain_loss\nvalid_loss\naccuracy\ntime\n\n\n\n\n0\n0.301779\n0.248262\n0.899480\n06:38\n\n\n1\n0.244484\n0.202708\n0.921480\n06:38\n\n\n2\n0.189148\n0.194167\n0.926160\n06:37\n\n\n3\n0.148741\n0.191470\n0.929720\n06:38\n\n\n\n\n\n\nlearn.predict(\"I really liked that movie!\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n('pos', tensor(1), tensor([7.8042e-04, 9.9922e-01]))\n\n\nAnd boom! You have a state-of-art sentiment analyzer."

    "section": "The Important of Validation and Test Sets",
    "text": "The Important of Validation and Test Sets\nWe’ve trained our model and it’s looking pretty smart, but know how do we know it’s actually learned something useful? This is where validation and test sets come in.\n\nWhy Do We Need a Validation set?\nThe goal of a model is to make predictions about unseen data. If we trained a model with all our data and evaluated it using the same data, we wouldn’t realy know how well it performs on new, unseen data. It could just memorize the training data(cheating basically). The model could get great results on your training data but bomb when given the data to analyze. To avoid this, we: - We split dataset: We divide our data into traning and validation sets. The trainning set is used to teach the model, and the validation set is used to see how well it’s learning\n\n\nPreventing Overfitting with a Test set\nOverfitting is a common issue where the model preform exceptionally well on the traning set but poorly on the validation set, meaning it has memorized the training data rather than learing the generalizable pattern.\nEven when your model hasn’t fully memorized all your data, it might memorized certain parts of it during earlier traning stages. The longer you train, the better the accuracy on the traning set, but eventually, the validation accuracy will start to decline. This is because your model is begins memorizing the traning data instead of learning the parttern that generalize well. When this happens, we say the model is overfitting.\nHere’s an example to visualize overfitting:\n\n\n\n\nExample of overfitting\n\n\nThe Image shows what happends when you overfit, using a simplified example where we have just one parameter and some randomly generated data. Although the overfitted model’s prediction are accurate for the data near the observed data points, they are way off when outside of that range.\nOverfitting is the single most important and challenging issue when training machine learning models. It’s easy to create a model that does the great job at making predictions on the data it’s been trained on, but making accurate predictions on new data is much harder.\nFor instance, if you writting a handwriteen digit classifier (as we will very soon) and use it to recognize numbers on checks, you won’t see the same numbers the model was trained on–checks will have different variations of handwriting to deal with."

    "text": "Wrapping Up\nDeep learning is an exciting field that extends far beyond simple image classification. From understand speech to translate langugaes and detecting malware, it’s applications are vast. Through this blog post, we’ve seen how to build a bird classifier using the fastai library-an accessible, powrful tool that simplifies the complexities of machine learning.\nBy spllitting our data into traning and validation sets, we ensure our model doesn’t cheat and genuinely learns the task at hand. With powerful tools like fastai and the aibility to handle the deverse tasks, deep learning truly has potential to transform numerous industries.\nI hope you enjoyed this journey as much as I did. Remember, the key to mastering deep learing is to keep experimenting and learning. So go ahead, build that next big thing, and maybe teach your computer to recognize your pet fish or translate cat’s meows!"
